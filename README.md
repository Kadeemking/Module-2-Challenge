# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description

For this project we were tasked with creating a portfolio for ourselves. I used the skills I learned from my previous CSS lessons how to style my pageand make it mobile responsive. I was able to design my page with background images and colors to add personality to my portfolio. I created a nav bar with links that help navigate the user through the page. I included a photo of my 1st project as well as a live link to the project.
