# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description

For this project we were tasked with creating a portfolio for ourselves. I used the skills I learned from my previous CSS lessons how to style my pageand make it mobile responsive. 

- I was able to design my page with background images and colors to add personality to my portfolio. 

- I created a nav bar with links that help navigate the user through the page. 

- I included a photo of my 1st project as well as a live link to the project. 

- I used Media Query to make my page mobile responsive.
